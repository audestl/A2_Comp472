The χ-Puzzle

# How to run it: 

To run this program, simply select the algorithm you want to run. By default, it will run a 2X4 puzzle.

The setup branch of this project is the actual master branch used for the submission



# Contribution of each student:

For this assignment, we decided to work on every part together. We worked on it by sharing screen with Zoom.


# Note: 

We decided to not include all of the individuals files for the 50 puzzles of the analysis part because it seemed unreasonable. Instead, we compiled all the results into one file per algorithm and per heuristic (the analysis.txt files). The solution files and the search files included into the project are the ones from the sample input given by the teacher.

GreedyBestFirst is a runnable python file like the other algorithms, even if it doesn't have the .py extension
